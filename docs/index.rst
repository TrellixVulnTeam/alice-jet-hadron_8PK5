The **ALICE Jet-Hadron Correlations** analysis package provides post processing analysis code for some of the
ALICE Jet-Hadron correlations analyses. The analysis code depends on main analysis code in AliPhysics, as well
as the supporting `Reaction Plane Fit <https://github.com/raymondEhlers/reactionPlaneFit>`__ and `Pachyderm
<https://github.com/raymondEhlers/pachyderm>`__  python packages. Documentation on the modules of the
jet-hadron analysis code are available below. For further information on this package, see the :doc:`README
<about>`.
